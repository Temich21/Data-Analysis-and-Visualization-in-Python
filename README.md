## Data Analysis and Visualization in Python
My "Data Analysis and Visualization in Python" repository is a compilation of coursework from my studies at the FIT faculty. This repository consists of three main folders, each dedicated to a specific aspect of data analysis:

## Key Features:
- **Download (Parsing):** In this section, I showcase my proficiency in data acquisition and parsing. I have tackled various tasks related to web scraping and data collection, employing tools like BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from websites.
- **Data Preparation:** This folder highlights my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation. I utilize libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to efficiently prepare and organize data for analysis and visualization.
- **Data Visualization:** In this section, I demonstrate my ability to create informative and visually appealing data visualizations. I leverage libraries like Seaborn to generate insightful charts, graphs, and plots that facilitate data interpretation. <br/><br/>
Throughout this repository, you'll find examples of my work with essential data analysis and machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. These tasks encompass a range of techniques, from basic data retrieval to advanced machine learning applications.<br/><br/>
My "Data Analysis and Visualization in Python" repository reflects my dedication to mastering the tools and techniques necessary for effective data analysis and visualization in the Python ecosystem.
