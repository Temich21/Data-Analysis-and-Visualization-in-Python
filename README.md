# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-in-Python
Data Analysis and Visualization in Python
The aim of the course is to acquaint students with the problems of data acquisition, processing, analysis and visualization using the cross-platform scripting language Python. It has a sophisticated ecosystem offering a rich spectrum of extension libraries, either in the form of native code or in terms of performance of efficient extensions implemented in C / C ++.
During the lectures students will learn Python constructs, methods of data acquisition, storage and manipulation, possibilities of advanced computations in numerical and symbolic level and visualization of acquired data. In this course, students will also gain an overview of the properties of techniques for advanced analysis of data dependencies and their applications for various data. Finally, Python will be expanded to include custom designs and techniques to effectively overcome the disadvantages of the interpreted language for performance-oriented applications. In the practical part (project), students will go through all stages of large data processing - from the design stage, through processing to subsequent analysis and visualization.
